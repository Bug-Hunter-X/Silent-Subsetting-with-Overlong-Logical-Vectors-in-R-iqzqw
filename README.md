This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic behavior in R when subsetting data frames using logical vectors.  The code in `bug.R` attempts to subset a data frame with a logical vector that has more elements than rows in the data frame. R silently truncates the logical vector to the length of the data frame, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution in `bugSolution.R` shows how to check the length of the logical vector against the number of rows and throw an informative error to prevent this.
